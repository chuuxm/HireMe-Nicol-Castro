    <marquee><h1>All About Nicol!</h1></marquee>
        <p>Nicol Castro is a sixteen year old in the eleventh grade. As a passtime outside of school, she enjoys being on her phone. Her favorite movie is Monster House - which is about a trio of teenagers that enter their neighbor's house, unaware that the house is alive, and it devours those who trespass into and onto the property. She doesn't have a favorite artist, but she enjoys listening to music in Spanish. Nicole said she sees herself as a detective in the next ten years. Her favorite colors are green and pink.</p>
