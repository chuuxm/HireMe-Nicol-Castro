        <p>I am a sixteen year old in the eleventh grade. I live in the south side of Williamsburg, and I live with four family members. I'm the youngest girl in the family. My favorite subject is English, and I'm billingual, speaking fluently in both Spanish and English. My birthday falls on the 20th of May. My favorite holiday is Thanksgiving.

        <p>My favorite movie is Monster House - which is about a trio of teenagers that enter their neighbor's house, unaware that the house is alive, and it devours those who trespass into and onto the property. I don't have a favorite artist specifically, but I greatly enjoy listening to music in Spanish.
